#First check environment (Mac OS X or Linux): Assume apt-get for Linux, port for Mac OS X

#Then install python3, pip3, python3-dev, and virtualenv

#Then create/generate the virtualenvironment according to spec and use pip to install all packages

#That should be it.. for now the required packages are 'Flask' and 'flask-restful'
